[Read Week 3 material](./processing-week3.md)

The key topics covered in Week 3 are:

1. **Color Modes**: You'll learn about the differences between RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color modes, and how to use each effectively in your sketches.

2. **Color Manipulation**: You'll explore techniques for adjusting individual color components, creating color palettes, and generating smooth color gradients.

3. **Transparency and Blending**: You'll learn how to work with the alpha (transparency) channel, as well as different blending modes that allow you to create layered, semi-transparent effects.

The third project for this week is an interactive, color-driven generative pattern. This will allow you to put all these color-related concepts into practice and create visually engaging, dynamic sketches.

The practice exercises further explore color theory and visual effects, including a color mixer UI, animated gradients, and transparency layering.

After completing Week 3, you'll have a strong foundation in using color to enhance the aesthetics and interactivity of your Processing sketches.
