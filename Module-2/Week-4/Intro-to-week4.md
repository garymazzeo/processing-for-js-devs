[Read Week 4 material](./processing-week4.md)

The key topics covered in Week 4 are:

1. **Coordinate Transformations**: You'll learn how to use the `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()` functions to transform the coordinate system and manipulate the placement and orientation of shapes.

2. **Nested Transformations**: You'll explore how to create hierarchical structures by nesting transformations, allowing you to build complex, interrelated systems like a solar system animation.

3. **Transformation Management**: You'll understand the importance of `push()` and `pop()` for saving and restoring the transformation state, which is crucial for maintaining control over your sketches.

The fourth project for this week is an animated solar system sketch, which will put all these transformation concepts into practice. You'll create a hierarchical structure with the sun, earth, and moon, and experiment with different animation speeds.

The practice exercises further explore nested transformations, camera controls, and dynamic composition techniques. These will help you develop a deeper understanding of how to use transformations to create engaging, responsive visual experiences.

After completing Week 4, you'll have the foundational knowledge to start working with more advanced visual programming concepts in the next module.
