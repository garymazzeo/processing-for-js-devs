The key topics covered in Week 2 are:

1. **Variables**: Storing and updating state over time is crucial for animation. You'll learn how to declare, initialize, and use variables to control the motion and appearance of your sketches.

2. **Frame Rate**: Understanding frame rate and how to control it using `frameRate()` is important for creating smooth animations. You'll also learn how to calculate time-based motion using the `deltaTime` concept.

3. **Mouse and Keyboard Interaction**: Responding to user input through the mouse and keyboard is a core part of making your sketches interactive. You'll learn how to access mouse position and detect clicks and key presses.

4. **Basic Motion Algorithms**: You'll implement fundamental motion concepts like velocity, acceleration, bouncing, and simple steering behaviors to create dynamic animations.

The second project for this week is an interactive bouncing ball sketch, which will allow you to put all these concepts into practice. The practice exercises also build on these fundamentals with more complex simulations.

After completing Week 2, you'll have a solid grasp of the fundamentals needed to start creating more advanced visual effects and interactive experiences in Processing.
