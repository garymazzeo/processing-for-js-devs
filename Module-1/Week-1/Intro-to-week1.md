I'll elaborate on Week 1's content by writing detailed concept documentation that would serve as your reading material for the first week. This is the kind of material you'd read before doing the hands-on exercises.

This is the kind of detailed documentation you'd read for Week 1. It's written by me specifically for JavaScript developers, but it's inspired by and references concepts from official Processing documentation and books like Daniel Shiffman's "Learning Processing."

The weekly study pattern I mentioned would work like this for Week 1:

1. **Read concept documentation (2-3 hours)**

   - [Read through the Week 1 material](./processing-week1.md)
   - Review the official Processing reference for any concepts you want to explore further
   - Look at example sketches in the Processing IDE

2. **Complete coding exercises (3-4 hours)**

   - Work through the three practice exercises listed
   - Type out and run each code example
   - Make small modifications to understand how things work

3. **Experiment with variations (2-3 hours)**

   - Try combining different shapes and colors
   - Modify the example code in unexpected ways
   - Break things on purpose to understand limits

4. **Work on weekly project (4-5 hours)**

   - Create your static composition
   - Try multiple versions
   - Polish your favorite version

5. **Review and refactor code (1-2 hours)**
   - Look back at your code
   - Add comments explaining what you learned
   - Clean up and organize your sketch
   - Save variations you want to build on later
